Description:

A network of political violence and protest data for Africa (undirected, weighted). Nodes are actors of each event (governments, militias, organisations etc.) and actors are linked if they are involved in the same event. 

The weight of each edge is determined by event count (number of events that they co-appear in) or by fatality count (number of people who died due to the events that they co-appear in). Thus, two networks are created (one by events, another by fatalities).



All Years (Events)
 "ACLED_Graph_Events.gml"
Nodes: 3536

Edges: 7542

Global Clustering Coefficient: 0.0880138323387


Diameter: 14.0

All Years (Fatalities)
 "ACLED_Graph_Fatalities.gml"
Nodes: 2380

Edges: 4363

Global Clustering Coefficient: 0.0937252243453


Diameter: 15.0

Technical Details: 
The data source contains details for each event, such as event type, day of event, actors involved and fatalities. There approximately 100,000+ rows of data (each row is an event that occurred in a day). 
Each actor has a code that relates them to a particular group (governments, militias, organisations etc.)
. Only events that involve 2 actors are included in the network.
